Introduction to Programming Languages
=================================
we can choose any High Level programming language 
C => MileStone 
C++ 
Pascal
Visual C++
Java
.Net etc.,

We will code using english language and converted into machine level language using translators (compiler or interpreter).

Java
====
BuzzWords
=========
S2 PORMA HI D2

Simple => easy and simple to learn
Secure => 
Platform Independent 
Object Oriented
Robust 
Multithreaded 
Architecture Neutral
High Performance
Interpreted
Distributed
Dynamic =>

Java supports to use methods or code from native languages like c and c++ or python or javascript etc,

History of Java

Example of First Program in Java
==========================
public class MyName {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		System.out.println("Mouritech ");
	}

}

The above program is structure of java program

Data types in Java
===============
Integer
=====
byte ==== 1 byte
short ===2 byte
int==== 4 byte
long ===8 bytes

Float
====
float ==== 4 byte
double ==== 8 byte

Character
========
char ==== 2 byte
Unicode => arabic,katakana etc., =>I 18 N (Internationalization)

Boolean
=======
boolean => 1 bit

literals
======
values stored in the memory

integer literal  => Example : -35,-564564564,45,45678
floating point literal   => Example : -35.00,-564564564.123,45.09,45678.345
character literal => Example : 'A','$','&' etc.,
boolean literal   => Example :- true or false

variable
======
an unique memory location to store the data which changes continuously

Identifier
=======
to identify the variables,classes or methods or packages or constants in memory we use identifiers.

Note: We cannot start the identifiers using digits
====

example: MyName => class name is an identifier
=======
Rules for writing the class name in java
===============================
1.  Class Name always starts with Capital letter
2. If there is a second word inthe class name that word also start with capital letter
3. we can use _,$ to separate two words or to add symbols to the class name
4.  there is no space between two words in the classname
5. class name and file name should be same

Rules for writing the variable names in java
==================================
1. Write the proper names for storing the data 
2. variables uses camelCase
     Example:=> companyName,aadharNo,dataOfBirth etc,
3. we can use _,$ to separate two words or to add symbols to the variable names
4.  there is no space between two words in the variablename


Rules for writing the constant names in java
==================================
1. Write the proper names for storing the data 
2. constant names uses uppercase
     Example:=> PI,MINIMUMBALANCE
3. we can use _,$ to separate two words or to add symbols to the constant names
4.  there is no space between two words in the constant names

Rules for writing the methods names in java
==================================
1. Write the methods names for writing the code to access the data
2. variables uses camelCase
     Example:=> printCompanyName(),printAadharNo(),printDataOfBirth() etc,
3. we can use _,$ to separate two words or to add symbols to the methods names
4.  there is no space between two words in the methods  names.

Rules for writing the package names in java
==================================
1. Write the proper package  names for grouping the similar code
2. package Name is declared in lowercase letters
     Example:=> arithmeticoperations,arithmetic_operations etc.,
3. we can use _,$ to separate two words or to add symbols to the packages names
4.  there is no space between two words in the packages names.

What are packages in java?
=====================
packages are group of similar files under one single name

it is good practice in java to group the files under a package ,
to access them easily in future

There are two types of packages
=========================
user defined packages
==================
programmers who are using java can also create there own packages using following syntax

syntax:
======
package <packagename>

Example:
=======
package arithmeticoperations;

Note: package declaration is the first line of code in the Java program
====
pre defined packages
=================
which are already part of java software,written by developers who developed java
example:
=======
java.io
java.lang
java.sql
java.util etc.,
400 + predefined packages are available in java



Structure of the Java program
========================

package declarations;
import statements;
//code

Executing Java Program from commandline
==================================

creating the package from commandline
================================


Comments in Java
==============
comments are used to add some details about the code in the java file ,which increases the readability of the code.

Java has 3 types of comments:
========================
single line comment =>//
multiline comment => /*      */
documentation comment => /**      */

Operators in Java
==============
Arithmetic Operators 
Logical Operators
BitWise Operators
Comparision Operators or Relational Operators
Ternary Operator
Assignment Operator
